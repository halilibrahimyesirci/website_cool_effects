# Flask Template

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python Flask project. In this sample, we use `flask` to build a web application and `pytest` to run tests.

Project by: Halil Ä°brahim Yesirci

 For a more in-depth tutorial, see the [Flask tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask).

 The code in this repo aims to follow Python style guidelines as outlined in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Running the Sample

To successfully run this example, we recommend the following VS Code extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Python Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) 

- Open the template folder in VS Code (**File** > **Open Folder...**)
- Create a Python virtual environment using the **Python: Create Environment** command found in the Command Palette (**View > Command Palette**). Ensure you install dependencies found in the `requirements.txt` file
- Ensure your newly created environment is selected using the **Python: Select Interpreter** command found in the Command Palette
- Run the app using the Run and Debug view or by pressing `F5`
- Navigate to the Test Panel to configure your Python test or by triggering the **Python: Configure Tests** command from the Command Palette
